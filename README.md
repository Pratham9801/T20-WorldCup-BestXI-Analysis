# Project Sportan

## Short Description / Objective
The ICC T20 World Cup 2022 had a lot of thrilling performances across teams. Inspired by this, we imagine a fun scenario:  

ðŸ›¸ **Aliens have challenged Earth to a cricket match!**  
If they win, the planet is theirsâ€¦ if we win, they leave us forever

**Performance Analysis:** Clean, transform, and analyze ICC T20 World Cup 2022 data using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. Evaluate batting, bowling, and team performance through key metrics like Strike Rate, Economy, Batting Average, and Bowling Average.  

Using insights from our analysis, we identify the **Best Playing XI across all countries** â€” Earthâ€™s strongest team to take on the challenge.

**Data Source:**  
- Raw data collected from the ESPN Cricinfo website in JSON format.  
- Since direct web scraping tools were not available, JSON files were downloaded with the help of [Codebasics.io](https://codebasics.io/) resources.
